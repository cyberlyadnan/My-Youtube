## Features

- **Improved Performance**:
  - Achieved a 40% increase in app speed by implementing lazy loading, debouncing, and caching techniques.

- **State Management**:
  - Utilized Redux for efficient state management, ensuring seamless video playback and user interaction.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Designed with Tailwind CSS to provide a responsive and visually appealing interface across all devices.

- **Deployment**:
  - Deployed on Google Firebase, ensuring high availability and scalability for a global audience.

- **Live Section Functionalities**:
  - Implemented real-time updates through efficient API polling, enhancing the live video experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Google Firebase
- **Tools and Libraries**: Parcel (Bundler), Jest (Testing), React Testing Library, Babel

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or Yarn (v1.22 or higher)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

Build the application for production and deploy it to Firebase:

1. Build the app for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. Deploy to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```
